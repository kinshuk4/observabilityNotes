Reading and Monitoring Related Talks, Blog Posts, and Videos

## Why?

While preparing for my talk at Velocity Conference, I aggregated and went through a ton of materials related to monitoring, kubernetes, and prometheus. After speaking with several conference and talk attendees, I realized that others might benefit from my tendency to over-prepare and read a ton of material!

The talk itself: TBA

The slides: [Observability in a Dynamically Schedule World](https://www.slideshare.net/SnehaInguva/observability-in-a-dynamically-scheduled-world)
